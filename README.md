## Global Options

You can pass some settings to Diffbot like this:

Diffbot.configure do |config|
  config.token = ENV["DIFFBOT_TOKEN"]
  config.instrumentor = ActiveSupport::Notifications
end
```

The list of supported settings is:

* `token`: Your Diffbot API token. This will be used for all requests in which
  you don't specify it manually (see below).
* `instrumentor`: An object that matches the [ActiveSupport::Notifications][1]
  API, which will be used to trace network events. None is used by default.
* `article_defaults`: Pass a block to this method to configure the global
  request settings used for Diffbot::Article requests. See below the options
  supported.
